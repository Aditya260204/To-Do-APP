# To-Do-APP
I evolved a simple but functional To-Do app the usage of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which permits customers to add, display, and delete duties. The app's interface includes an input discipline for the task, some other for choosing a due date, and a button to feature new tasks to the list. Once added, the obligations are displayed in a dependent format, such as their due date, and every challenge has a "Delete" button to put off it from the listing.

In the JavaScript code, I used an array named todoList to keep the obligations and their respective due dates. The addTodo characteristic captures the consumer's enter and appends a brand new project to the array. Once a undertaking is introduced, the displayItems characteristic dynamically generates HTML code to display the project on the display screen, inclusive of the delete button for each object. The delete functionality is accomplished the use of the splice() approach, which removes the chosen challenge from the array and updates the displayed list.

The format is styled using CSS, where the enter fields and buttons are aligned the use of a grid format for a clean and organized interface. The "Add" and "Delete" buttons are styled with wonderful colours for higher person interplay. The app is straightforward however demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM, presenting real-time updates to the user interface
